1. Kinship (Nickel et al., 2011, alyawarradata.mat): This is a 104 × 104 × 26 binary tensor consisting of 26 types of relations among a set of 104 individuals in Australian Alyawarra tribe. The data was first collected by Denham and White (2005) to study the kinship system in the Alyawarra language. The tensor entry Y(i,j,k) is 1 if individual i used the kinship term k to refer to individual j, and 0 otherwise.

data$Rs: 104 × 104 × 26
data$features: 14 features for the 104 individuals


2. Nations (Nickel et al., 2011, dnations.mat): This is a 14 × 14 × 56 binary tensor consisting of 56 political relations of 14 countries between 1950 and 1965. The tensor entry indicates the presence or absence of a political action, such as “treaties”, “sends tourists to”, between the nations. We note that the relationship between a nation and itself is not well defined, so we exclude the diagonal elements Y(i,i,k) from the analysis.



3. Enron (Zhe et al., 2016, digg_tensor.Rdata): This is a 581 × 124 × 48 binary tensor consisting of the three-way relationship, (sender, receiver, time), from the Enron email dataset. The Enron data is a large collection of emails from Enron employees that covers a period of 3.5 years. Following Zhe et al. (2016), we take a subset of the Enron data and organize it into a binary tensor, with entry Y(i,j,k) indicating the presence of emails from a sender i to a receiver j at a time period k.

4. HCP (Wang et al., 2017a, Count_VSPLOT.mat): This is a 68 × 68 × 212 binary tensor consisting of structural connectivity patterns among 68 brain regions for 212 individuals from Human Connectome Project (HCP). All the individual images were preprocessed following a standard pipeline (Zhang et al., 2018), and the brain was parcellated to 68 regions-of- interest following the Desikan atlas (Desikan et al., 2006). The tensor entries encode the presence or absence of fiber connections between those 68 brain regions for each of the 212 individuals.
